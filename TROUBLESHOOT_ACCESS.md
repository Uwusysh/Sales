# ⚠️ STILL ACCESS DENIED

The system is **still blocked**. The "Editor" permission was not applied correctly.

## PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK:

1.  Open Share Settings: [Google Sheet Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BUvKvc0E8iynfiixIC9cU_8SrmH6MHf5XJ11892kT7g/edit)
2.  Look for this email in the list: `sheets-access-sales@ai-team-482111.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
3.  **Ensure it says "Editor"** next to it (NOT "Viewer").
    *   *If it says "Viewer", change it to "Editor" and click Save.*
    *   *If it's not there, add it again.*

## Alternative: Make it Public (Last Resort)
If you cannot get the adding to work, you can temporarily:
1.  Click "Share" -> "General Access".
2.  Change "Restricted" to **"Anyone with the link"**.
3.  Change "Viewer" to **"Editor"**.

**Tell me "Fixed" when you have verified the "Editor" role.**
