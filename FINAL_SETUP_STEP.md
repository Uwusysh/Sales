# 🛑 CRITICAL SETUP STEP REQUIRED

The application is connected, but **ACCESS IS DENIED**.
The Service Account is **locked out** of the Spreadsheet.

## YOU MUST DO THIS TO FIX IT:

1.  Open your Google Sheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BUvKvc0E8iynfiixIC9cU_8SrmH6MHf5XJ11892kT7g/edit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BUvKvc0E8iynfiixIC9cU_8SrmH6MHf5XJ11892kT7g/edit)
2.  Click the big **"Share"** button (top right).
3.  In the "Add people" box, paste this EXACT email:
    
    ```
    sheets-access-sales@ai-team-482111.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    ```

4.  **IMPORTANT:** Change the permission dropdown on the right from "Viewer" to **"Editor"**.
5.  Click **Send**.

### Why?
The system needs to **Write** data and **Create** tabs (Leads, SRF, etc.). Without "Editor" access, it fails immediately.

**Once you have done this, tell me "Done" and I will finish the setup.**
