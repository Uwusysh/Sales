Schedule a follow-up\n2. Check server console logs:\n   - 🔍 Looking for empty follow-up slot...\n   - ✅ Found empty slot: X\n   - 📝 Saving to: Follow_Up_X_Date = date\n   - ✅ Follow-up saved successfully to row Y, slot X\n\n3. Refresh lead details to see timeline\n4. Check Google Sheets for Follow_Up_1-5 columns\n\nThis will help identify if slots are saving correctly!\n\n🤖 Generated with Claude Code\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n\\)\")"
